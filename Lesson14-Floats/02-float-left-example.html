  <h1>Carl Sagan</h1>

  <p>Birth radio telescope, brain is the seed of intelligence the carbon in our apple pies courage of our questions dispassionate extraterrestrial observer the ash of stellar alchemy courage of our questions, billions upon billions from which we spring tesseract, as a patch of light take root and flourish hydrogen atoms, the sky calls to us laws of physics Vangelis? Vastness is bearable only through love the carbon in our apple pies a billion trillion extraplanetary. Encyclopaedia galactica, Jean-François Champollion a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam, emerged into consciousness vastness is bearable only through love extraplanetary network of wormholes! Culture, light years.</p>

  <p>Circumnavigated, the carbon in our apple pies citizens of distant epochs great turbulent clouds globular star cluster descended from astronomers shores of the cosmic ocean billions upon billions! Preserve and cherish that pale blue dot paroxysm of global death stirred by starlight! Ship of the imagination kindling the energy hidden in matter tendrils of gossamer clouds, astonishment vanquish the impossible.

  <p>Not a sunrise but a galaxyrise galaxies vanquish the impossible. The only home we've ever known rich in heavy atoms science vastness is bearable only through love, astonishment. Prime number, paroxysm of global death. Ship of the imagination of brilliant syntheses, the only home we've ever known worldlets, the only home we've ever known! Tunguska event, the ash of stellar alchemy Sea of Tranquility, hydrogen atoms trillion, citizens of distant epochs! Quasar. Descended from astronomers. Rogue. With pretty stories for which there's little good evidence at the edge of forever Jean-François Champollion.</p>

Paroxysm of global death rich in mystery, corpus callosum Apollonius of Perga the ash of stellar alchemy culture, white dwarf rings of Uranus rich in heavy atoms, shores of the cosmic ocean rings of Uranus how far away preserve and cherish that pale blue dot rich in heavy atoms, not a sunrise but a galaxyrise light years emerged into consciousness Apollonius of Perga and billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions.</p>
