# Step one in building the messageboard server:
# An echo server for POST requests.
#
# Instructions:
#
# This server should accept a POST request and return the value of the
# "message" field in that request.
#
# You'll need to add three things to the do_POST method to make it work:
#
# 1. Find the length of the request data.
# 2. Read the correct amount of request data.
# 3. Extract the "message" field from the request data.
#
# When you're done, run this server and test it from your browser using the
# Messageboard.html form.  Then run the test.py script to check it.

from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler
from urllib.parse import parse_qs


class MessageHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_POST(self):
        # 1. How long was the message? (Use the Content-Length header.)

        # 2. Read the correct amount of data from the request.

        # 3. Extract the "message" field from the request data.

        # Send the "message" field back as the response.
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/plain; charset=utf-8')
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(message.encode())
