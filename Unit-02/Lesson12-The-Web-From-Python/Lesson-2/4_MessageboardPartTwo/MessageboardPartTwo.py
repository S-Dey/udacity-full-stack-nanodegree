# Step two in building the messageboard server:
# A server that handles both GET and POST requests.
#
# Instructions:
#
# 1. Add a string variable that contains the form from Messageboard.html.
# 2. Add a do_GET method that returns the form.
#
# You don't need to change the do_POST method in this exercise!
#
# To test your code, run this server and access it at http://localhost:8000/
# in your browser.  You should see the form.  Then put a message into the
# form and submit it.  You should then see the message echoed back to you.

from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler
from urllib.parse import parse_qs


class MessageHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_POST(self):
        # How long was the message?
        length = int(self.headers.get('Content-length', 0))

        # Read the correct amount of data from the request.
        data = self.rfile.read(length).decode()

        # Extract the "message" field from the request data.
        message = parse_qs(data)["message"][0]

        # Send the "message" field back as the response.
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/plain; charset=utf-8')
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(message.encode())
